My first car was a 1978 Buick Ltd.
When I was in my 20s, and had money problems, I slept in my car for more than a week, slept in my apartment, without electricity, for more than a month, and slept in New York’s Central Park for several nights.
I drove a cab in NY for 8 years. As a cab driver, I was robbed twice at gunpoint. 
I have a library of more than two thousand books.
